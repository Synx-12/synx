<h1>How to Make Tea</h1>
<p>Making tea is a simple process that can be done in a few easy steps. Here's a basic guide to making a cup of tea:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Boil water in a kettle or pot until it reaches a rolling boil.</li>
  <li>Place a tea bag or loose tea leaves into a mug or teapot.</li>
  <li>Pour the boiling water over the tea, ensuring it covers the tea fully.</li>
  <li>Let the tea steep for 3-5 minutes, depending on desired strength (longer for stronger tea).</li>
  <li>Remove the tea bag or strain out the loose leaves.</li>
  <li>Add milk, sugar, lemon, or other additives to taste, if desired.</li>
  <li>Serve and enjoy your tea while it's hot.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember, the type of tea you use (black, green, herbal, etc.) may require different steeping times and water temperatures for the best flavor. Experiment with different teas and brewing methods to find your perfect cup!</p>
